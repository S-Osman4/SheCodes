📖 Challenge Instructions
Ring, ring!📱 It's time for the First Phone Challenge! This month, unleash your coding skills and create a captivating landing page that brings your first phone back to life. Whether it was a brick-sized dino, a flip phone with a tiny screen, or the first smartphone that barely fit in your pocket, celebrate the technology that kept you connected. Dive into the retro vibes, bring out those nostalgic ringtones, and maybe even a game of Snake! 🐍 Let's see how you can make the old new again!

Incorporate various elements (e.g., text, buttons, links, and images) to make your landing page stand out. Describe what made this phone unforgettable. Was it the chunky design, its pixelated games, or the classic ringtone? Highlight the key features of your chosen phone model, and share fun facts or nostalgic stories about it.  🌟
