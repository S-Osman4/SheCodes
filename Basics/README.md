## SheCodes Basics Final Project

Welcome to my final project for the **SheCodes Basics workshop**! This project is a fun and interactive introduction to coding that takes inspiration from the epic fantasy world of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D).

## Project Overview

This landing page is all about immersing users in the magical world of Dungeons & Dragons. With just a click, users can enter their name and roll to see which role they’ll take on in an epic adventure. The page dynamically updates to show the user’s character, along with a custom description and image.

### Features:

* **Interactive Experience**: Users can interact with the page by clicking a button to reveal their unique D&D character role.
* **Fantasy-Themed Design**: The design includes medieval-style fonts, fantasy imagery, and a color palette that gives the page a magical feel.
* **Responsive Layout**: The page is designed to look great on any device, whether it’s a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
* **CSS**: Styling of the webpage, including custom fonts, colors, and layout.
* **JavaScript**: Interactivity, including role selection and dynamic text updates.
